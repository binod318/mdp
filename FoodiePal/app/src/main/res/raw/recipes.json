    "ingredients": "½ white onion (or 1 shallot, diced)\r\n1 large tomato , grated (skin discarded)\r\n2 green chilies (or red chillies, diced)\r\n½ cup chopped cilantro leaves\r\n2 cloves garlic , grated\r\n½ lime , juiced\r\n2 teaspoons sugar\r\nSalt , to taste\r\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\r\n5 oz. minced pork , with 20% fat - for meat option\r\n5 oz. tofu , crumbled (+ 3 tablespoons finely minced mushrooms) - for vegetarian option\r\n3 scallions , finely sliced\r\n1 green chilli , finely chopped\r\n2 teaspoons grated ginger\r\n2 teaspoons grated garlic\r\n1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro\r\n¾ cup finely diced Hispi cabbage\r\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\r\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\r\nSalt , to taste\r\nOil , to brush",
    "instruction": "In a bowl, mix the flour, 5 tablespoons of oil, and salt. Add water little by little and mix until obtaining a soft dough.\r\nDust the work surface with flour and knead the dough till it is silky and smooth.\r\nLightly oil the dough, and keep it covered in a bowl for 30 minutes.\r\nRoll the dough out on the work surface till it is thin and nearly transparent.\r\nUse a cookie cutter, a plastic cap or a glass (4 inches / 9 cm diameter) and cut circles out from the dough.\r\nIn a bowl, mix the chosen filling, mince or tofu, with all other ingredients for the filling.\r\nKnead the filling a bit to get a homogenous mass.\r\nTake one circle of dough in the palm of the hand or on a board.\r\nIn the center, place a heaped teaspoon of the filling.\r\nUsing the thumb and index finger, crimp the edges and bring them together in the center to form a dumpling. Leave ¼ inch (½ cm) open on top or close it completely. If making a round form is difficult, the dough can be folded over to make a half-moon pastry-pie shape, and crimp the edges to close.\r\nIn a steamer, pour water about 2 inches (5 cm) deep. Bring to a boil.\r\nLightly oil the steam basket or layer it with lightly oiled baking paper.\r\nArrange the momos around with an inch (2 cm) space between the momos.\r\nCover the steamer, and steam the momos on medium to high heat, for 15 mins. The momos look shiny and transparent when cooked.\r\nSteam the momos in batches, as all will not fit in at one go. Keep the cooked momos warm under a tea towel or in a container.\r\nServe the momos warm with soy sauce and chilli sauce in separate bowls.\r\n",
